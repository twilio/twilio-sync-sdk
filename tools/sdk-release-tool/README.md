sdk-release-tool
================

sdk-release-tool allows you to list, upload, and update new Twilio SDK
releases to [media.twiliocdn.com](//media.twiliocdn.com). These releases are
stored in S3 and fronted by CloudFlare. Refer to the [2.0 SDK URLs]
(//wiki.hq.twilio.com/display/SDK/2.0+SDK+URLs) for more information.

Installation
------------

Install sdk-release-tool by running

```
$ make
```

sdk-release-tool will check for files cdn-sdki.prod.json, cdn-sdki.stage.json,
and cdn-sdki.dev.json in the sdk-release-tool directory. If any of these are
not found, sdk-release-tool will prompt you to provide them:

```
$ make

Please provide the AWS access key for cdn-sdki in (prod).

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: â–ˆ
```

If you would rather use credentials set in environment variables and would like to skip the prompt. Install with the following flag.

```
$ make SKIP_CREDENTIALS=1 install
```

If you would like to use environment variables as credentials then set the following accordingly

```
AWS_DEV_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_DEV_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_STAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_STAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_PROD_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_PROD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

See [Credentials](#credentials) for information.

Credentials
-----------

sdk-release-tool updates Amazon S3 buckets. You need the cdn-sdki IAM user
credentials to do this. There is a cdn-sdki IAM user credential for dev, stage,
and prod. A member of the RTD or SDK Teams should be able to share these
securely with you; if not, file an [iRequest](https://issues.corp.twilio.com)
to gain access.

Schemas
-------

Once installed, you can start using sdk-release-tool with any supported SDK.
SDKs can be supported by adding JSON schema files describing the S3 directory
structure for each.

Version Numbers
---------------

SDKs should use [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](http://semver.org) of the form

```
1.2.3-dev+build
```

Version numbers of the form

```
1.2.3.b4-deadbee
```

are deprecated, but sdk-release-tool will continue supporting them for the
time being.

Do not use latest/ URLs with JavaScript SDKs
--------------------------------------------

Do not specify latest/ URLs or use the [pin-latest](#pin-latest) command with
JavaScript SDKs. If a customer uses such a URL in a &lt;script&gt; tag, then
their application will break as soon as we release a breaking change. For this
reason, latest/ URLs are an anti-pattern and disallowed for JavaScript SDKs.

Usage
-----

For a new release, a typical workflow is

1. [list](#list) existing versions (and ensure they are what you expect)
2. [upload](#upload) your new version
3. [pin](#pin) the new version (assuming it is not a pre-release)

Note that all of the commands documented below accept a realm flag, i.e.

* `--dev`
* `--stage`
* `--prod`

For the sake of example, all of the commands below are written as if modifying
dev. You can run the same commands against stage or prod by passing a different
realm flag.

### list

List the version numbers of uploaded product artifacts and any pinned
major/minor pairs or "latest" versions. For example, the following shows 6
artifacts for `$product-js` in dev, 1 of which is a pre-release version, and two
pinned versions, v1.0 and v2.0; finally, 2.0.1 is pinned "latest":

```
$ ./list $product-js --dev
1.0.0
1.0.1
1.0.2 <- v1.0
2.0.0-dev
2.0.0
2.0.1 <- v2.0 (latest)
```

### upload

Upload product artifacts to a version number. For example, the following
uploads artifacts for `$product-js` 1.2.3 to dev:

```
$ ./upload $product-js 1.2.3 $source_folder --dev
dist/$product.js -> sdk/js/$product/releases/1.2.3/$product.js
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what artifacts would be uploaded.

By default, the same artifact may not be uploaded twice. To override this
behavior, pass `-f` or `--force`.

### pin

Pin a major/minor pair to a version number. For example, the following pins
v1.0 to version 1.0.1 in dev:

```
$ ./pin $product-js 1.0.1 --dev
sdk/js/$product/v1.0/ -> sdk/js/$product/releases/1.0.1/
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what S3 Key redirects would be updated.

By default, a pre-release version cannot be pinned. To override this
behavior, pass `-f` or `--force`.

### pin-latest

Pin a "latest" to a version number. For example, the following pins
"latest" to version 1.0.1 in dev:

```
$ ./pin-latest $product-js 1.0.1 --dev
sdk/js/$product/latest/ -> sdk/js/$product/releases/1.0.1/
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what S3 Key redirects would be updated.

By default, a pre-release version cannot be pinned. To override this
behavior, pass `-f` or `--force`.

### download

Download product artifacts from a version number. For example, the following
downloads artifacts for `$product-js` 1.2.3 to /tmp from dev:

```
$ ./download $product-js 1.2.3 --dev
sdk/js/$product/releases/1.2.3/$product.js -> /tmp/dist/$product.js
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what files would be downloaded.

### delete

_You should not need to use this!_

Delete product artifacts at a version number. For example, the following
deletes 1.2.3 from dev:

```
$ ./delete $product-js 1.2.3 --dev
sdk/js/$product/releases/1.2.3/$product.js
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what files would be deleted.

By default, a pinned version cannot be deleted. To override this behavior,
pass `-f` or `--force`.

By default, every file to be deleted requires confirmation. To override this behavior, pass `-s` or `--silent`

### unpin

_You should not need to use this!_

Unpin a major/minor pair from a version number. For example, if v1.0 were
pinned to 1.0.1, the following would unpin it in dev:

```
./unpin $product-js 1.0.1 --dev
```

You almost _never_ need to use this. Instead, refer to [pin](#pin).

Pass `--dry-run` to see what S3 Key redirects would be updated.

### unpin-latest

_You should not need to use this!_

Unpin a "latest" from a version number. For example, if "latest" were
pinned to 1.0.1, the following would unpin it in dev:

```
./unpin-latest $product-js 1.0.1 --dev
```

You almost _never_ need to use this. Instead, refer to [pin](#pin).

Pass `--dry-run` to see what S3 Key redirects would be updated.
