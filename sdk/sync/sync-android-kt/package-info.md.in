# Module Sync Android SDK

This package provides the classes necessary to create a Twilio Sync client application.

**Min SDK**: $ANDROID_MIN_SDK_VERSION

Twilio Sync is Twilio's state synchronization service, offering two-way real-time communication 
between browsers, mobiles, and the cloud.

Sync relies on the concept of state synchronization. In this model, the authoritative state of 
your application exists in the cloud and is actively replicated – whether in whole or in part – 
to all of your users across all of your devices. The code you write is responsible for 
manipulating and representing this state: telling Sync when a customer is online/offline, their 
position on a website, or any other thing. Doing that, the Sync service does the rest, and 
makes sure that your devices are always kept up to date in real-time, surviving connection 
failures and other network aberrations.

Sync Objects are the primitives you use to make your application's state discoverable and 
accessible at the right granularity. Sync provides four different object primitives to help.

**Documents**: A SyncDocument is a single JSON object, up to 16kb in size. It is best suited to
simple use cases, such as basic publish/subscribe or where history synchronization is not a 
requirement.

**Lists**: A SyncList maintains an ordered list of individual JSON objects, each up to 16kb in size.
Use this object for more advanced use cases, such as synchronizing location data with the 
ability to replay old location states. Individual items are accessible through a system 
generated index.

**Maps**: A SyncMap maintains an unordered collection of developer specified keys and values.
Use this object for synchronization cases where clients are interested in updates to individual 
keys, such as in presence use cases.

**Message Streams**: A SyncStream lets you broadcast ephemeral JSON messages at a high rate to a group
of subscribers.
